abstract = "The motion of spine in passive quadrupedal bounding and its effect on leg behavior were presented in this paper. First, a simplified sagittal plane model of quadruped mammals was introduced. The model's body contained one articulated spine joint. Next, a control method was developed to obtain symmetrical bounding of the model. In this method, the spine joint was locked when the spine reached its maximum bend. It was held until vertical velocity became opposite in value. These actions resulted in a specific type of bounding, which was defined as quasi passive bounding. Despite its simplicity, this system captures properties of real animals. Plenty of bounding conditions were considered in the analysis of system kinetics. Passive bounding of the model with stiff spine was also analyzed. A comparison of the maximum leg compression between the two models suggests the use of spine joint for legged systems at a high speed. Moreover, to obtain realistic motion of quadruped mammals, evolution of the spine joint angle shows that trunk stiffness in extension is greater than that in flexion."

abstract = {Locomotion was first achieved by the motion of the spine. The limbs came after, as an improvement, not as a substitute; and yet, analysis of bipedal gait concentrates almost exclusively on the motion of the limbs. The requirements for land locomotion are examined from a general point of view and the evolution of the vertebrate spine is presented as a mechanism designed to move the animal. The necessary spinal movements are also analysed; the role of the musculoskeletal system is discussed and it is shown that the lumbar spine is a key structure in land locomotion, the pelvis being driven by the spine. The optimum control of motion demands that the stress at all the intervertebral joints should be minimized and equalized. This theory of locomotion requires the central nervous system to control the torque at those intervertebral joints and suggests that a breakdown of the control system would result in torsional failure of the spine. The theory is supported by EMG, force and torque data collected from several sources.},

This popular hypothesis appears to have been accepted with little substantiation. In light of the numerous observations contradicting this view, we have proposed an alternative hypothesis in which the spine and its surrounding tissues comprise the basic engine of locomotion. This theory is consistent with available experimental data which suggest that the motion of the spine precedes that of the legs. Indeed, the variations in the power delivered to the pelvis by the spine are strikingly similar to, but slightly ahead of, the variation in power at the hip."

Periodic motions of the legs switch between the swinging and supporting stages based on the phase of the oscillators. The oscillators receive touch sensor signals at the end of the legs as feedback when the leg touches the ground and compose a steady limit cycle of the total periodic dynamics of quadruped locomotion. And also muscle tone is adaptively controlled according to the dynamic state of the main body. This system can generate gait transition from one to another by changing locomotion speed and muscle tone. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed controller were evaluated with numerical simulations and experiments with the hardware.},

abstract={Most legged vertebrates use flexible spines and supporting muscles to provide auxiliary power and dexterity for dynamic behaviors, resulting in higher speeds and additional maneuverability during locomotion. However, most existing legged robots capable of dynamic locomotion incorporate only a single rigid trunk with actuation limited to legs and associated joints. In this paper, we investigate how quadrupedal bounding can be achieved in the presence of an actuated spinal joint and characterize associated performance improvements compared to bounding with a rigid robot body. In the context of both a new controller structure for bounding with a body joint and existing bounding controllers for the rigid trunk, we use optimization methods to identify the highest performance gait parameters and establish that the spinal joint allows increased forward speeds and hopping heights.},

   abstract = {A newborn foal can learn to walk soon after birth through a process of rapid adaptation acting on its locomotor controller. It is proposed here that this kind of adaptation can be modeled as a distributed system of adaptive modules (AMs) acting on a distributed system of adaptive oscillators called Adaptive Ring Rules (ARRs), augmented with appropriate and simple reflexes. It is shown that such a system can self-program through interaction with the environment. The adaptation emerges spontaneously as several discrete stages: Body twisting, short quick steps, and finally longer, coordinated stepping.},

abstract ={Robotics researchers increasingly agree that ideas from biology and self-organization can strongly benefit the design of autonomous robots. Biological organisms have evolved to perform and survive in a world characterized by rapid changes, high uncertainty, indefinite richness, and limited availability of information. Industrial robots, in contrast, operate in highly controlled environments with no or very little uncertainty. Although many challenges remain, concepts from biologically inspired (bio-inspired) robotics will eventually enable researchers to engineer machines for the real world that possess at least some of the desirable properties of biological organisms, such as adaptivity, robustness, versatility, and agility.},

year={2010},
month={March},
volume={2},
number={1},
pages={40-50},
abstract={How can human infants gradually socialize through interaction with their caregivers? This paper presents a learning mechanism that incrementally acquires social actions by finding and reproducing the contingency in interaction with a caregiver. A contingency measure based on transfer entropy is used to select the appropriate pairs of variables to be associated to acquire social actions from the set of all possible pairs. Joint attention behavior is tested to examine the development of social actions caused by responding to changes in caregiver behavior due to reproducing the found contingency. The results of computer simulations of human-robot interaction indicate that a robot acquires a series of actions related to joint attention such as gaze following and alternation in an order that almost matches the infant development of joint attention found in developmental psychology. The difference in the order between them is discussed based on the analysis of robot behavior, and then future issues are given.},

abstract={To gain a synthetic understanding of how the body and nervous system co-create animal locomotion, we propose an investigation into a quadruped musculoskeletal robot with biologically realistic morphology and a nervous system. The muscle configuration and sensory feedback of our robot are compatible with the mono- and bi-articular muscles of a quadruped animal and with its muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. The nervous system is designed with a biologically plausible model of the spinobulbar system with no pre-defined gait patterns such that mutual entrainment is dynamically created by exploiting the physics of the body. In computer simulations, we found that designing the body and the nervous system of the robot with the characteristics of biological systems increases information regularities in sensorimotor flows by generating complex and coordinated motor patterns. Furthermore, we found similar results in robot experiments with the generation of various coordinated locomotion patterns created in a self-organized manner. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical interaction between the physics of the body with the neural dynamics can shape behavioral patterns for adaptive locomotion in an autonomous fashion.},
