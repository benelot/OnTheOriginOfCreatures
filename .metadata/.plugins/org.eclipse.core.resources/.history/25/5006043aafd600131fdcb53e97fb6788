	/*
	 * The genotype descriptions of virtual brains and the actual pheno- type
	 * brains are both directed graphs of nodes and connections. The nodes
	 * contain the sensors, neurons, and effectors, and the connec- tions define
	 * the flow of signals between these nodes. These graphs can also be
	 * recurrent, and as a result the final control system can have feedback
	 * loops and cycles. However, most of these neural elements exist within a
	 * specific part of the creature. Thus the genotype for the nervous system
	 * is a nested graph: the morphological nodes each contain graphs of the
	 * neural nodes and connections. Figure 3 shows an example of an evolved
	 * nested graph. When a creature is synthesized from its genetic
	 * description, the neural components described within each part are
	 * generated along with the morphological structure. This causes blocks of
	 * neural control circuitry to be replicated along with each instanced part,
	 * so each duplicated segment or appendage of a creature can have a similar
	 * but independent local control system. These local control systems can be
	 * connected to enable the pos- sibility of coordinated control. Connections
	 * are allowed between adjacent parts in the hierarchy: the neurons and
	 * effectors within a part can receive signals from sensors or neurons in
	 * their parent part or in their child parts. Creatures are also given a set
	 * of neurons that are not associated
