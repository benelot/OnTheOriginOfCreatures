	/*
	 * The genotype descriptions of virtual brains and the actual pheno- type
	 * brains are both directed graphs of nodes and connections. The nodes
	 * contain the sensors, neurons, and effectors, and the connec- tions define
	 * the flow of signals between these nodes. These graphs can also be
	 * recurrent, and as a result the final control system can have feedback
	 * loops and cycles. However, most of these neural elements exist within a
	 * specific part of the creature. Thus the genotype for the nervous system
	 * is a nested graph: the morphological nodes each contain graphs of the
	 * neural nodes and connections. Figure 3 shows an example of an evolved
	 * nested graph. When a creature is synthesized from its genetic
	 * description, the neural components described within each part are
	 * generated along with the morphological structure. This causes blocks of
	 * neural control circuitry to be replicated along with each instanced part,
	 * so each duplicated segment or appendage of a creature can have a similar
	 * but independent local control system. These local control systems can be
	 * connected to enable the pos- sibility of coordinated control. Connections
	 * are allowed between adjacent parts in the hierarchy: the neurons and
	 * effectors within a part can receive signals from sensors or neurons in
	 * their parent part or in their child parts. Creatures are also given a set
	 * of neurons that are not associated with a specific part, and are copied
	 * only once into the phenotype. This gives the opportunity for the
	 * development of global synchro- nization or centralized control. These
	 * neurons can receive signals from each other or from sensors or neurons in
	 * specific instances of any of the creatureâ€™s parts, and the neurons and
	 * effectors within the parts can optionally receive signals from these
	 * unassociated-neu- ron outputs. In this way the genetic language for
	 * morphology and control is merged. A local control system is described for
	 * each type of part, and these are copied and connected into the hierarchy
	 * of the crea-
