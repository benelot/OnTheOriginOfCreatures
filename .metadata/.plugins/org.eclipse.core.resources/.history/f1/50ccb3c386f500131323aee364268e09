	 * Internal neural nodes are used to give virtual creatures the possibility
	 * of arbitrary behavior. Ideally a creature should be able to have an
	 * internal state beyond its sensor values, or be affected by its history.
	 * different neural nodes can perform diverse functions on their inputs to
	 * generate their output signals. Because of this, a creatureâ€™s brain might
	 * resemble a dataflow computer program more than a typical neural network.
	 * This approach is probably less biologically realistic than just using sum
	 * and threshold functions, but it is hoped that it makes the evolution of
	 * interesting behaviors more likely. The set of functions that neural nodes
	 * can have is: sum, product, divide, sum-threshold, greater-than, sign-of,
	 * min, max, abs, if, interpolate, sin, cos, atan, log, expt, sigmoid,
	 * integrate, differentiate, smooth, memory, oscillate-wave, and
	 * oscillate-saw. Some functions compute an output directly from their
	 * inputs, while others such as the oscillators retain some state and can
	 * give time varying outputs even when their inputs are constant. The number
	 * of inputs to a neuron depends on its function, and here is at most three.
	 * Each input contains a connection to another neuron or a sensor from which
	 * to receive a value. Alternatively, an input can simply receive a constant
	 * value. The input values are first scaled by weights before being operated
	 * on. For each simulated time interval, every neuron computes its output
	 * value from its inputs. In this work, two brain time steps are performed
	 * for each dynamic simulation time step so signals can propagate through
	 * multiple neurons with less delay.
